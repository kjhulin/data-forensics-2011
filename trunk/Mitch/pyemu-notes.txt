To get library calls to work :

Python>emu.os.get_library_address('memset')   <---- doesn't work before
False

Python>emu.os.add_library('msvcrt', 'memset')
True

Python>hex(emu.os.get_library_address('memset'))   <----- works after add_library call
0x76409790


Python>emu.set_memory(0x0040613C, 0x76409790, size=4)
True
	- 0x0040613C is the line in IDA where it shows the import address of memset
	- "0040613C  memset msvcrt"




Python>emu.get_disasm()     <---- the actual call
call 0x401c90
Python>emu.execute()
True
Python>emu.get_disasm()     <---- jmps to the library
jmp [0x40613c]
Python>emu.execute()
True
Python>emu.get_disasm()     <---- hmm, doesn't show the instruction? (though no memory is loaded for it)
False
Python>emu.execute()        <---- ...?
[*] Need a handler for [{'name': 'memset', 'address': 1983944592}]
False


So, adding the library by itself still fails. Adding the library + setting the memory at the library jmp to the address returned from get_library_address doesn't cause it to crash saying :

raise RuntimeError, "The memory requested was invalid"

but it does say "Need handler for..."
